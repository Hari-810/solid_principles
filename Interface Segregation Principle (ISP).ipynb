    "Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interface Overload:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Machine interface is monolithic, combining methods for printing, scanning, and faxing documents into a single interface.\n",
    "This forces every class that implements Machine to provide implementations for all methods, regardless of whether they need them or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unnecessary Implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Printer class, which logically should only print documents, is forced to implement methods like scan_document() and fax_document() from the Machine interface.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This leads to unnecessary code in Printer (NotImplementedError implementations) and potential confusion for developers trying to understand the class's intended functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes like Printer should ideally focus only on printing documents and not be burdened with implementing methods for scanning or faxing.\n",
    "    Violating SRP can lead to classes that are harder to maintain, understand, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential for Bugs and Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a developer forgets to implement a required method (like scan_document() or fax_document() in AllInOneMachine), it can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduced Code Clarity and Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Developers might find it challenging to understand the purpose of each class (Printer, AllInOneMachine) if they are forced to implement methods they don't need.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Maintenance Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Over time, as requirements change or new features are added, maintaining a monolithic interface can become cumbersome.\n",
    "    Changes in one part of the interface (Machine) might require modifications across multiple classes (Printer, AllInOneMachine), increasing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difficulty in Extension and Adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Adding new types of machines (e.g., a scanner-only device) would require modifying the existing monolithic interface (Machine), potentially affecting all classes that implement it.\n",
    "    This can hinder the flexibility and scalability of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Violating the Interface Segregation Principle by using a monolithic interface (Machine) with unrelated methods (print_document, scan_document, fax_document) forces unnecessary dependencies and responsibilities on classes (Printer, AllInOneMachine) that may not need them. This approach leads to code that is harder to understand, maintain, and extend, ultimately increasing the likelihood of introducing errors and reducing overall code quality."
