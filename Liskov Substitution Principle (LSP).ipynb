    "Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Semantic Misrepresentation: The BitcoinProcessor subclass inherits from PaymentProcessor but cannot actually process Bitcoin payments. This creates a semantic mismatch where a subclass is expected to behave like its superclass (PaymentProcessor) but cannot fulfill that contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Runtime Errors: When a BitcoinProcessor instance is passed to a function expecting a PaymentProcessor, such as handle_payment, it throws an exception (Exception: Bitcoin payment processing is not supported). This breaks the program flow and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Violation of Client Expectations: Clients using the PaymentProcessor superclass expect that any subclass (CreditCardProcessor, BitcoinProcessor, etc.) can be used interchangeably. However, BitcoinProcessor fails this expectation by throwing an exception instead of processing payments like other subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Maintenance Challenges: Future modifications to add more payment processors might lead to similar issues if subclasses do not adhere to the expected behavior defined in the superclass (PaymentProcessor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code Fragility: The code becomes fragile because client code (handle_payment function or any code expecting a PaymentProcessor) cannot reliably substitute any subclass without potential runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduced Flexibility: Introducing new payment processors (e.g., EthereumProcessor, BankTransferProcessor) that may behave differently could further complicate the system and potentially break existing client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difficulty in Testing and Debugging: Testing becomes challenging because the behavior of subclasses (BitcoinProcessor) deviates from the expected behavior defined by the superclass (PaymentProcessor), leading to inconsistencies and hard-to-predict outcomes.\n",
