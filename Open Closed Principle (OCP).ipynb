    "1. Violation of Single Responsibility Principle: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The ShapeDrawer class handles both drawing shapes and calculating their areas. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because it has more than one reason to change. Each additional shape requires modifications in multiple places within the ShapeDrawer class, increasing the risk of introducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Difficult to Extend: Adding new shapes requires modifying the ShapeDrawer class in multiple places. Specifically, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add new elif branches in the draw_shape method.\n",
    "    - Add new elif branches in the calculate_area method.\n",
    "    - This makes the class more complex and harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fragile Code\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Every time you add or change a shape, you risk breaking existing functionality. For instance, a typo or logical error in the new elif branches can affect the entire shape drawing and area calculation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Poor Scalability\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As the number of shapes increases, the ShapeDrawer class will grow disproportionately, leading to a large and unwieldy class that's hard to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing Challenges\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Testing the ShapeDrawer class becomes more complex as you add more shapes. Each new shape means more test cases and potentially more points of failure within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Encapsulation Issue\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The shape-specific drawing and area calculation logic are tightly coupled within the ShapeDrawer class. This violates the principle of encapsulation, where each shape should ideally manage its own behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Readability and Maintainability\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As the list of shapes grows, the readability and maintainability of the ShapeDrawer class degrade. It's harder to track which shapes are supported and how they are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Adding a New Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new shape (e.g., a pentagon), you would need to modify both the draw_shape and calculate_area methods. \n",
