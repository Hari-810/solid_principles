    "The initial Employee class with multiple methods (calculate_monthly_salary, produce_monthly_hours_report, save_modifications) violated SRP because different departments (Finance, HR, R&D) could request changes affecting these methods, leading to excessive coupling and potential bugs.\n",

    "\n",
    "To resolve this, the responsibilities were separated into individual classes:\n",

    "- Employee: a simple data structure.\n",
    "- PaymentService: handles salary calculations.\n",
    "- WorkHoursService: handles work hours report.\n",
    "- EmployeeDAO: handles data access and persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, each class has a single responsibility, reducing the likelihood of unintentional side effects when changes are made.\n"
